      "title": "Level 1: Basic Maze Navigation",
      "content": "The player begins in a simple maze environment. Learn to navigate around walls (@) and wall blocks, while managing moveable colored blocks (gray blocks marked as 'g'). The goal is to reach the green endpoint (e) while understanding basic movement mechanics."

    {
      "title": "Level 2: Block Manipulation",
      "content": "A more complex maze introduces strategic block placement. Players must push and arrange gray blocks (g) to create pathways through the maze. The level teaches advanced movement patterns and spatial reasoning as blocks can be pushed in chains."

      "title": "Level 3: Keys and Doors",
      "content": "Introduction of key-door mechanics. Players must collect a yellow key (+) to open a brown closed door (c), which transforms into an open door allowing passage. Orange blocks (o) and gray holes (h) add complexity, requiring careful planning to avoid getting blocks stuck."

      "title": "Level 4: Teleportation System", 
      "content": "The most advanced level featuring colored teleporter pairs. Red-Purple teleporters (d-i), Blue-Orange teleporters (a-f), and Green-Gray teleporters (m-l) allow instant transportation across the maze. Players must master teleporter mechanics while still managing keys, doors, and block placement to reach the endpoint."

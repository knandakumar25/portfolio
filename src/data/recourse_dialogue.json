  "game_description": "A maritime interactive fiction where you play as a negotiator for the East India Company, trying to convince your shipmates to continue their perilous journey to England despite an approaching storm. Guided by divine visions from Varuna, the Hindu god of the ocean, you must use persuasion and moral choices to prevent disaster.",
  "setting": "1800s East India Company ship sailing from colonial India to England",
  "main_character": "An unnamed negotiator returning to England to see family after serving in the colonies",
  
  "story_summary": {
    "backstory": "You play as [Redacted], returning to England (where you have lived since you were employed) from serving at your homeland colony as a negotiator for the East India Company to see your family again after several months. You are accompanied by six other people on your journey, and the ship's Captain. One rainy night, the crew gathers to discuss a storm brewing in the destination's direction and argues that returning is the safest option. The captain decides a vote will take place tomorrow by nightfall to decide the crew's fate.",
    
    "divine_vision": "You dream of a terrible tragedy: your ship sinks, and everyone on board drowns. You see the very moment that causes this disaster—when the crew votes to return to the colony and turns the ship around. It is that choice, you realize, that leads to their doom. Then a powerful figure appears: Varuna, the Hindu god of the ocean your people worship. He speaks to you through the crashing waves, telling you that this fate does not have to happen. He has chosen you to stop it.",
    
    "main_goal": "Your goal is to convince your fellow crewmembers to continue your journey and vote to maintain course. You only have to convince three of them, as the majority of votes wins. You can only try to convince each person once, so be mindful of your choices! Once you gather enough votes, go to the captain and let him settle the vote. Fail to do so, and a terrible fate awaits!"
